# Server deployment

The FastAPI image conversion server (`server/`) is a separate Python service.
It is excluded from the Vercel build (`.vercelignore`) and ships as its own Docker image.

## Build & run

```bash
cd server
docker build -t image2-server .
docker run -p 8000:8000 image2-server
```

Health check: `GET /health`

## Deploying

Push the `image2-server` image to a host that runs containers (Fly.io, Railway, Render,
a VPS, etc.). The container listens on port 8000 and needs no extra config or secrets.

CORS origins are hardcoded in `server/main.py` (`CORSMiddleware`). Add any new frontend
origin there before deploying.

### Version reporting

`GET /health` includes a `version` field, used to confirm a deploy actually
shipped (see README's "Build/deploy versions"). On Railway this is populated
automatically from `RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`. On other hosts without an
equivalent, set `IMAGE2_SERVER_VERSION` (e.g. to the image tag or commit SHA)
so `/health` doesn't just report `"dev"`.

### Logging

Conversion requests log their computed `cols`/`rows`/`cells` at INFO, and any
422 ("Output dimensions exceed server limits") logs the offending values plus
the active `MAX_OUTPUT_*` limits at WARNING. Set `LOG_LEVEL` (e.g. `DEBUG` or
`WARNING`) to adjust verbosity — defaults to `INFO`.

## Wiring up the Next.js app

The browser calls the FastAPI server directly (`lib/convert.ts`) — image
uploads no longer go through a Next.js API route. This avoids Vercel
Functions' 4.5MB request body limit, which 413'd on larger images when the
upload was proxied through `/api/convert`.

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE2_SERVER_URL` to the deployed server's base URL (e.g.
`https://image2-server.fly.dev`) as a Vercel environment variable. Since it's
exposed to the client, ensure the URL is the public CORS-allowed origin from
`server/main.py` and add any new frontend origin there before deploying.

Local dev defaults to `http://localhost:8000` if `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE2_SERVER_URL`
is unset.
